Welcome to the second week of class.
Today you will work in groups of two. Please answer questions in succinct words.
Assignment is:
1) In each group, one person will fork this repository
2) Add your partner as a collaborator
3) Answer questions on this txt separately on separate machines (This will require both students separately pulling the forked repository)
4) Add this file, commit and push
5) Make a pull request

Edit below:
Person A's Name: Bao Yu Xie 
Person B's Name: Angela Guo

Question for A:
1) What does git clone do?
It clones a repository into a new directory. 

2) What is a remote repository?
Remote repository is version of your project/code that is hosted on the Internet or such.

Question for B:
1) Why is version-control framework such as git important?
It is because it allows teams to easily collaborate with one another by working on shared codes individually and simply “push” code so that their teammates are able to see and access. 

2) Explain the concept of branching in git
Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes sure that unstable code is never committed to the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your feature’s history before merging it into the main branch.
